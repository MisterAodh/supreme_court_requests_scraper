            "The High Court was the more \nappropriate forum for d etermin ing the issue of whether Section 12(6)(b) is \ncompatible with the Directive and, having rega rd to the provisions of Article 34 \nof the Constitution, the contention that the High Court should have relinquished  \nits Article 34  jurisdiction in favour of the WRC is unpersuasive  (paras 56-61).",

            "However, such a difference in \ntreatment may be ju stified under Article 6(1) of the Directive  (para 62(1)& (2))  \n \n(4) It is not the case that the Directive presumptively requires case by case or \nrole by role assessment or that such individual assessment must be shown to be \n \nPage 66 of 68 \n impr actical if a generally appl icable retirement age is to be justified .",
            "Provided \nthat the aim sough t is legitimate and the means of achieving that aim are  \n\u201cappropriate and necessary \u201d (proportionate) , a mandatory retirement rule does \nnot offend the prohibition on age discrimination in the Directive , \nnotwithstanding that it does not entail an individual assessment of those  subject \nto that rule (para s 66-77).",
            "(5) In light of the CJEU jurisprudence (para 62(5)  \u2013 (7) above), t he aims \nidentified by the State Respondents as justifying the application of a mandatory \nretirement age  of 70  in the public service, and the application of that retirement \nage to sheriffs , clearly constitute  legitimate aims for the purposes of Article 6(1) \nof the Directive .",

            "While the State could have elected to fix the mandatory \nretirement age  at a level higher or lower than 70  (or c ould have decided not to \nhave any general retirement age) , provided that the prescribed retirement age \nappears reasonably designed to achieve the objectives being pursued , the \nrequirements of Article 6(1) will be satisfied  (paras 87 -97).",
            "(7) As regards th e position of sheriffs specifically, the fact that persons \nappointed to that office are free to combine it with continuing practice as a \nsolicitor (or barrister) is a highly significant factor in assessing the \nproportionality of requiring their retirement at age 70.",
            "For many \u2013 including Mr \nMallon \u2013 the office will not be their sole source of income while holding the \noffice of sheriff and they may also continue in practice after retirement from th at \noffice .",
            "If they have made the necessary contributions, they will be eligible to \nreceive the State Pension (Contributory) from age 66 (as Mr Mallon does).",
            "No \ncase is made here that the requirement for  sheriffs to retire at age 70 is likely to \ngive rise to any finan cial hardship  (ibid).",
            "(8) As a matter of principle, the State may provide for the application of a \ndifferent retirement age to a specific category of public servants where there is \na rational and objective basis  for doing so and one of the considerations  that the \nState may take into account in that context is the need to maintain the effective \ndelivery of public services in that area.",

            "(2) That decision in  JC does not simply reinstate the decision of the Court in  The \nPeople (AG) v O'Brien  insomuch as that case held that evidence obtained in a \ndeliberate and conscious breach of the Constitution, in the sense of an \nintentional breach rather than merely where the action leading t o the breach \nwas itself was deliberate, must be excluded; but subject to extraordinary \nexcusing circumstances.",

            "(3) The majority judgments in  JC expressly approve the decisions given in \nrespect of unlawful detention in breach of a right to liberty i n The People v \nMadden  (which was clearly stated in 1977),  The People v O'Loughlin  (which \nfollowed  Madden  in 1979), and in  The People (DPP) v Healy  (reaffirming the \nrelevant principles in 1990).",

            "(5) Hence, where evidence is obtained in breach of a constitutional r ight, even \nthough the breach is not deliberate and conscious in The People (AG) v \nO'Brien  sense, there is a presumption that such evidence must be excluded; see \nClarke J at [871](v).",

            "The decision is explicable as an instance where there had been a clear \nintention to respect the constitutional rights involved and to obtain a warrant in \nrespect of the premises and no objection was made when the warrant was \nexecuted.",
            "(7) JC also establ ishes the principle that even where evidence is obtained \nillegally, without breach of constitutional rights, there is an obligation on the \n \n \nPage 110 of 141 \n Court to consider whether it is necessary to exclude the evidence because \notherwise if to admit it would render the t rial unfair.",
            "An example is  The People \n(DPP) v Lawless  where the premises searched on a warrant that was in error \nwas not that of the accused but was the dwelling of another person.",

            "(8) JC is authority that any rule of exclusion should \u201calso exclude evidence \nobtained in reckless or grossly negligent disregard of the Constitution\u201d \n[487].",
            "Hence, the law does  not support a systemisation where inadvertence may \nbe deliberately chosen, as in seeking out an officer, in execution of a warrant or \nan arrest or the extension of detention, who knows nothing of the investigation, \nor in flagrant disregard of legal rules,  or in doing what suits through advertent \nblindness to what is required.",
            "In considering any question of inadvertence, or \ndeliberate and conscious breach of a constitutional right, consequently, the \nstate of mind under consideration is not only that of indi viduals, as it were, at \nthe coalface, [850], but also of any other senior official or officials within the \nrelevant enforcement or investigation authority who are involved in a material \nway in the process.",
            "The test also, therefore, necessarily looks to any  question of \nsystemic failure within an investigating team and not just the absence of any \ndeliberate and conscious breach on the part of the executing officer.",
            "(9) Finally, the test under which evidence obtained in breach of constitutional \nrights may be admitted, does not permit the evidence to be admitted if it could \n \n \nPage 111 of 141 \n never have been lawfully obtained; see [863].",
            "This, it should be understood, is \na further qualification on the admission of evidence.",

            "To do so assumes compliance with the Constitution, when the issue \narises precisely because there has been a breach.",
            "This is,  therefore, a backstop \ntest, and a further qualification which may usefully be understood as addressed \nto circumstances that where evidence was obtained in breach of constitutional \nrights, and although there was inadvertence or a subsequent legal developme nt, \nit would nevertheless render the trial unfair to admit such evidence.\u201d  \n \n171."

            "Page 136 of 141 \n (6) The answer to the first admissibility issue is, therefore, that the test for admiss ibility \nis indeed that set out in JC.",
            "(7) The fact that Mr Smyth and McAreavey did not assert or accept ownership of the \n691 phone or the 773 phone respectively does not have the significance suggested by \nthe Director.",

            "(7) The answer to the second admissibility issue is therefor e that, i n considering the \nadmissibility of the phone location and call data here, the fact that neither Mr Smyth or \nMr McAreavey  asserted or accepted ownership of the 691 phone or the 773 phone  is \nnot material .",
            "(8) The application of JC here does not involve or require any factual inquiry or \ninvestigation but, rather, an objective assessment of whether it was reasonable for An \nGarda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to rely on the provisions of the 2011 Act or whether such reliance \ninvolved a \u201c deliberate or cons cious \u201d breach of the Charter .",

            "This Court\u2019s \ndecision in Dwyer  is wholly inconsistent with the argument that , as of 2017, the 2011 \nAct was so clearly contrary to the Charter that it could not properly or reasonably be \nrelied on by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na .",
            "(9) By analogy with JC itself (where the search warrant had been issued pursuant to a \nstatutory provision subsequently struck down in Damac he), the illegality here arose as \na result of a \u201c subsequent legal development \u201d, namely the combined  effect of the CJEU\u2019s \njudgment in GD and the declaration subsequently granted by this Court when the \nproceedings came back before it.",
